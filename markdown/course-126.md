## Masters — Core 2
You will study four strands in this block, totaling 60 credits:

- **Data Analytics** — Statistics using scientific programming languages such as `Matlab` and `R`.

- **Programming** — Focusing on _scientific programming_, normally with `Matlab`, but also `Scilab` and `Python`.  You will learn the basics, up to solving problems.

- **Applied CS** — Topics include _computational complexity_, _metaheuristics_ and _Petri-nets_.

- **Theoretical CS** — You will study _membrane computing_, _finite state machines_, _quantum information theory_ and _game theory_.

- **Numerical Methods** — You will study _linear algebra_, _root-finding_, _interpolation_, _gradient descent_, _simulated annealing_, _eigenvector/values_, _principal component analysis_, and _error/difference analysis_.
